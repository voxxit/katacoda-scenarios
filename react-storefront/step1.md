We're going to work out of a completely fresh, temporary environment using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). The base image â€” [`node:8`](https://hub.docker.com/_/node#nodeversion) â€” contains the prerequisites to run React Storefront apps:

* Node.js v8.x
* npm v6.x
* git (to download some npm modules)

To help you get off the ground, run the [`create-react-storefront`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-storefront) CLI tool:

```
npx create-react-storefront myapp
```{{execute}}

It is used to generate a unique React Storefront project using interactive input from you. Start by filling in a few (_probably_ not real... yet ðŸ˜Ž) answers for `myapp`: 

* version
* repository URL
* license
* etc...

`create-react-storefront` will take your input and create a project skeleton, pre-filled configuration files, templates, and everything else you need to get off the ground! ðŸš€
